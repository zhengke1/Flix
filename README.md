### Notes
Working with a new environment still proves difficult. Maneuvering around Xcode is also little confusing. I accidentally clicked a few wrong buttons a few too
many times and could not figure out how to fix it; I ended up restarting the project half way through but it was a lot quicker the second time around. Working with
an API is still a little foreign to me, so that process took some effort. The most challenging part of this project was knowing which files to work on and where to
write my code.

### Notes
While trying to display the movie posters on the grid view tab, I made the mistake of using the wrong API key. Configuring the display of the posters on the grid view created some errors for me as they would not display correct.
